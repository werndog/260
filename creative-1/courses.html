                            <p>Near the Riverwoods in Provo is Riverview Park. It's a nice, quite little
                                park that has a short 9-hole disc golf course. The course at Riverview Park
                                is usually my go-to course for introducing people to disc golf because it's a
                                short course and all of the hole are relatively short and easy. The only problem
                                with this course is that there's a growing river that runs through it, and often 
                                other people at the park that you have to avoid while playing.

                            <p>The Spanish Fork disc golf course is currently my favorite course, probably because
                                it's one of the few not covered in snow. This course is located near the freeway tucked
                                in behind a little suburban area and has a full 18 holes. Half of the course is big open dirt field,
                                then transitions into a small forest, especially during the summer. There are a nice mix of straight
                                open shots while there are also a lot of holes with trees, requiring a more technical throw.

                            <p>Jolley's Ranch is in Hobble Creek Canyon and is my all-time favorite course. Jolley's Ranch
                                is a nice park lodged deep in the canyon, which makes it such a beautiful course.
                                There are 18 holes, some of which go straight through wooded areas while others go
                                over an open field. Sometimes you need to watch out for picnickers or family reunions,
                                but for the most part, patrons of the park are there for disc golf. The final hole
                                makes you finish with an awesome shot over a very wooded river.
